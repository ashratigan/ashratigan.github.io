            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>This was my first project as part of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. When this project was first assigned, I was worried I wouldn't know where to begin. But once, I broke it down into smaller steps, the project quickly became manageable. I began the project by trying to figure out the logic for tic tac toe.</p>
            <p>I began by breaking the logic up into smaller pieces. First, I wanted to click a square and see an X displayed. Next, I worked on getting the X to switch to an O on every other click. Then, I worked on figuring out the logic to determine a winner. After the game logic was solid I worked to connect it to a back end API, where clicking on New Game created a new game and where every move is a patch request recording the new move to that game.</p>

            <h3>In action</h3>
            <p>I am most proud of the gifs that display in the background depending on who wins. When a sun wins, a giant sun is displayed. When a moon wins, a multi-colored moon is displayed.</p>

            <p>I wanted to allow users to choose their playing pieces, and I was thrilled when I got this functionality working. Users can choose their piece from a drop down menu. I really enjoyed adding the dinosaur emojis as playing pieces, and I especially love the gifs that display when one of them wins.</p>
