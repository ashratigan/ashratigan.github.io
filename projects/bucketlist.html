            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I created a full stack, single page application where a user can sign up and create, see, update, and delete their own bucket lists. Growing up, I loved making bucket lists with my friends, and I thought this would be a fun idea to turn into a website. Before coding, I created an ERD, wireframe, and user stories. The back end was made using Ruby on Rails. The front end was made with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.</p>
            <p>After completing the planning, I made the back end using Ruby on Rails and a PostgreSQL database with a one to many relationship, where one user can have many bucket lists. Work on the front end began with styling bucket lists. </p> 
            <hr>
            <h3>In action</h3>
            <p>Using jQuery, I styled example bucket lists where users can add and cross off tasks. However, they will not be saved. These example lists are displayed on the welcome screen. </p>
            <img class="img" src="./images/bucket-list-home.gif">
            <p>Once signed in, users can create, update, and delete bucket lists that are connected to the back end using AJAX. To create a bucket list, users can enter a name for the list and then add items on their bucket list, separating each with a comma.</p>
            <img class="img" src="./images/bucket-list.gif">
            <p>Users can delete and update their bucket lists after they are created by using the bucket lists ID.</p>
